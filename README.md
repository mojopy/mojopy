### Hiya! :dizzy:

Mojopy here!

I'm that guy who probably tries to do too many things at once at all times!

By day, I'm an industrial electronics technician, by night I'm... sometimes a programmer, a DIYer, sometimes a translator, sometimes a weeb, sometimes an uncle, sometimes... a buncha of other things.

Frankly, I don't specialize in anything! And beyond the first, even then, everything I do is mostly for my own entertainment and or through my friends' or my family's suggestions.  :notes:

There IS one thing I somehow dropped over the years, now that I think about it... I used to fancy making my own designs and graphics, the whole kit when I was younger. I legit haven't really done that in over a decade. Hm, maybe I should get into that groove again...

>You'll wish that you had done some of the hard things when they were easier
to do.
