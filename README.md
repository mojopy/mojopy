### Hiya! :dizzy:

Mojopy here! (I'll make a fancier readme later)

I'm that guy who probably tries to do too many things at once at all times!

By day, I'm an industrial electronics technician, by night I'm... sometimes a programmer, a DIYer, sometimes a translator, sometimes a weeb, sometimes an uncle, sometimes... a buncha of other things.

Frankly, I don't specialize in anything! And beyond the first, even then, everything I do is mostly for my own entertainment and or through my friends' or my family's suggestions.  :notes:
